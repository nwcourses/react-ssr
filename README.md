# React server-side rendering

Basic example showing React server-side rendering.

This is partly based on the tutorial at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-server-side-rendering)

The example is designed for understanding the basic principles of React server-side rendering. In the real world you would probably use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
